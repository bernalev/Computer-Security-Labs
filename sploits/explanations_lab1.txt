=== Target 1 ===
Since buf is copied unsafely in target1, and is stored within the lab_main's frame, the goal was 
to overflow the buffer to overwrite lab_main's return address. We found the difference between the 
return address (RA) and the address of buf to be 124. Therefore, we passed in an arg of length 
124 into the target; the first 45 bytes contained the shellcode, were followed by \x30 bytes, and 
terminated with the RA overwrite bytes (buf's start address). Therefore when lab_main terminated, 
the next instructions that were read was the shellcode that was placed at the start of the buffer.

=== Target 2 ===
Target2 declares buf in foo and copies it for longer than its length => foo's RA will be overwritten. 
The length constraint in foo means that other values must be overwritten too: again the 
shellcode is placed at the start of the attack string and '\x30' is used as filler. However 
this time, 264 bytes-in, it is the value of foo’s i var that is overwritten, in order 
to skip past indices 266 and 267 (giving i=0x0000010b=267 ~ which is immediately incremented). Then len is 
overwritten with indices 268-270 of arg and with env[0] to give len=0x0000011c = 284, such that env[1] 
would be copied (as arg[280-283]) into foo's RA.

=== Target 3 ===
First the attack buffer is set to all 0xFF bytes for debugging, and then 0 - 44 
bytes of the shellcode is copied. Lastly 68 - 71 are the bytes representing the buffer start, 
which is where the shellcode sits. This overflows foo’s return address, and shell is started when foo 
returns.

=== Target 4 ===
We copy the shellcode, starting at the first byte of the attack. Then at 168th byte, we 
overfill it with the new length of the buffer, which is set to be 188, which now 
allows us to copy over the return address at 184-187 bytes. Then we overflow the 172th 
byte to 175th byte which now contains the new i value, however we set it to be 172 
as we don’t actually want to modify i. Lastly we overflow the return address. We also configure 
the env variable so that the args variable is able to pass in the full attack buffer.

=== Target 5 ===
We carefully design a format string starting at byte 60 that allows us to overfill the return 
address. We have an addrs variable which contain the addresses of the 4 bytes we wish to overfill, 
they are ordered by arguments in the format string. The return address is sitting at 0x2021fe768. 
So we construct our format string in the following order:
1. Write 32 empty bytes (0x20), written to 0x2021fe76b.
2. Write 1 byte, (0x21), written to 0x2021fe76a
3. Write 63 bytes, (0x60), written to 0x2021fe68
4. Write 153 bytes, (0xfa), written to 0x2021fe69.
Now the return address is overfilled, one byte at a time.

=== Target 6 ===
Target 6 required us to modify the shell code because we wish to execute the left branch 
of tfree. Thus the 5th byte of the shellcode needed to have a least significant bit of 
value 1. We injected NO-OPs into the shell code starting at byte 3, and we changed the 
initial jump instruction to jump 0x25 instructions.
- 60th byte has return address of tfree + 1 as it needs to be cleared in tfree
- 72th byte is left pointer with value of 0x104ee28, address of p.
- 76th byte is right pointer with address of the 60th byte of the attack
