=== Target 1 ===

Since buf is copied unsafely in target1, and is stored within the 
lab_main's frame, the goal was to overflow the buffer to overwrite 
lab_main's return address. We found the difference between the return 
address (RA) and the address of buf to be 124. Therefore, we passed 
in an arg of length 124 into the target; the first 45 bytes contained 
the shellcode, were followed by \x30 bytes, and terminated with the RA 
overwrite bytes (buf's start address). Therefore when lab_main terminated, 
the next instructions that were read was the shellcode that was placed 
at the start of the buffer.
