This university project was done to become familiar with common web application vulnerabilities. The project uses the WebGoat open-source tool to expose web vulnerabilties. The pdf file contains the assignment requirements, the explanations file contains my findings and the text files contain my solutions to be inputted to WebGoat. I completed the first four parts using JavaScript:
<ol>
    <li>Phishing with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</li>
    <li>Reflected XSS Attacks</li>
    <li>Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</li>
    <li>CSRF Prompt By-Pass</li>
</ol>
